# test_longest_palindromic

1. The first step must be checking the length of the charecter before looping the total of charecters

2. loop characters of size by input total length of characters to Array (use keys method  because it will get the range to begin 0 to the max length of characters)

3. create some variables to keep the position of the character (left position -1 and right position + 1)

4. the first while loop will be checking about a right position with characters of length and checking the position of the text by right pointer and position of the text by an index of for loop so will add value at right pointer every round + 1

5. the second, while loop will be checking about a left position with, then or equal 0 and checking about the position of the text by left pointer and position of the text by an index of text length so will be down the value 

6. the third while loop will be checking the value of the left pointer and right pointer and characters of length and position of the text by left pointer and a right pointer  will add value and down the value 

7. calculate find the result of the length  

8. checking about maxLength and long length for finding the first characters

9. the last step 
Use the substring method finding about characters from the first character to the last character
